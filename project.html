        <h3>let say something about scientific calculator</h3>
             <p>scientific calculatos performs the same function as their standard electronic 
        calculator counterparts,but they also have myriad other features available.there are three main 
        catagories of of calculators on market today ;business,basic,and scientific.the scientific calculator 
         how ever is the only one that can handle certain function in a field such as trigonometry, 
        physics,chemistry and engineering. a scientific calculor has Additional features that allow you work
      with exponents and logs which requires more memory in order to perform functions for the best result.
        while also you can do basic calculations such as addition,substraction,multiplication,and division,
        that barely scratches the surface of the types of equations this calculator can handle. those are the 
    three catagories of calculator:-</p>

             <!-- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML file is structured.
                 This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia on a webpage.
 HTML is a formal recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is generally adhered to by all major web browsers,
including both desktop and mobile web browsers. HTML5 is the latest version of the specification.
 HTML is a text file containing specific syntax, file and naming conventions that show the computer and the web server that
it is in HTML and should be read as such. By applying these HTML conventions to a text file in virtually any text editor, 
a user can write and design a basic webpage, and then upload it to the internet.The most basic of HTML conventions is the inclusion of a 
document type declaration at the beginning of the text file. This always comes first in the document,
 because it is the piece that affirmatively informs a computer that this is an HTML file. The document header typically looks like this: 
 <!DOCTYPE html>. It should always be written that way,
 without any content inside it or breaking it up. Any content that comes before this declaration will not be recognized as HTML
  by a computer.

 Doctypes are not just used for HTML, they can apply to the creation of any document that uses SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).
 SGML is a standard for specifying a specific markup language being used. HTML is one of several markup languages that SGML and doctype 
 declarations apply to.

The other critical requirement for creating an HTML file is saving it with a .html file extension.
 Whereas the doctype declaration signals HTML to the computer from the inside of the file, the file extension signals HTML to 
 the computer from the outside of the file.
 By having both, a computer can tell that it's an HTML file whether it's reading the file or not. This becomes especially 
 important when uploading the files to the web, because the web server needs to know what to do with the files before it can send them
  to a client computer for the inner contents to be read.

   XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and increase interoperability with other data formats .
    There are two main reasons behind the creation of XHTML: It creates a stricter standard for making web pages, 
    reducing incompatibilities between browsers. So it is compatible for all major browsers.

   HTML and XHTML are two mark up language which XHTML is more structured and used stricter than HTML5, and 
    requires that all tags be properly closed and in lower case . XHTML has some restriction about tags can be 
    nested inside each other.HTML is a markup language that was used to build the world's first webpage.
     Ever since this webpage was created, there have been a lot of modifications and variations done 
      in the HTML language, such as adding the concept of error handling,addition of new features such as a table, etc., 
       because of which XHTML came into the picture.
       Both XHTML and HTML5 prioritize accessibility and provide tools and techniques for creating accessible web pages. 
      This includes using semantic markup, providing alternative text for images, and using ARIA 
    (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers and 
    other assistive technologies.
